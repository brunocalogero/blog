# Hmmm

Hello there! I'm a full-stack software engineer :smile:

Currently, I'm engineering & designing for [Risk Ledger](https://riskledger.com) on all sorts of interesting [things](https://riskledger.com/company).

Previously, I was 'dev-opsing' at Cisco, facilitating the shift to code driven infrastructure.

I enjoy a weekly dose of Muay Thai & Yoga. Understanding the science of nutrition and health (physical & mental) is now a daily habit.

I'm particularly keen about cinematography & take particular joy in video editing.

I enjoy reading about... health, software engineering, fantasy & everything mythological (thus the large tattoo on my back).

I take interest in what decentralization/open-blockchains can bring to this world & the finance/on-chain data bonanza that comes with it.

I love music! Classical, blues, jazz, rock, heavy metal, hip hop, drum & bass... you name it, it's all beautiful. It's all connected and passed on (shout out Seamus Heaney).

This "portfolio" or "personal internet space" stems from an internal need to have a platform to express some - hopefully educated - thoughts on interesting learnings & discoveries (not that of my wonderful company <3).

I was greatly inspired by the awesome work from the Risk Ledger Engineering team...
