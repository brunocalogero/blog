Hello there! I'm a full-stack software engineer

I like to learn about new tech.

When I feel sporty, I enjoy a weekly dose of Muay Thai & your occasional Urdhva Mukha Shvanasana (because "upward-facing dog" sounds wierd...).

My hippy self enjoys the science of nutrition and health (physical & mental).

I'm particularly keen about all sorts of cinematography and take particular joy in making shitty video edits.

I enjoy reading about... fantasy, everything medieval (thus my large gothic etching black work tattooed on my back), health, software.

I take interest in naughty crypto investments.

I love music. all of it, from your classical, blues, jazz, rock, heavy metal, drum & bass... why are we even labelling, it's all beautiful. It's all connected and passed on (shout out Seamus Heaney).

This "portfolio" or "personal internet space" stems from an internal need to have a platform to express some thoughts (not that of my wonderful Company <3). I want to be able to have a place where I can write about new things that I've learnt about and the rest of the world that surrounds me. Let's be real, the more important things that are worth me spending some time to write about.
