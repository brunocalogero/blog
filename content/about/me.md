Hello there! I'm a full-stack software engineer :)

Currently, engineering & designing for <a href="https://riskledger.com">Risk Ledger</a>.

Previously, I was "dev-opsing" at Cisco, facilitating the shift to code driven infrastructure.

I like to learn about all sorts of tech.

I enjoy a weekly dose of Muay Thai & Yoga.

My hippy self enjoys the science of nutrition & health (physical & mental).

I'm particularly keen about cinematography & take particular joy in video editing.

I enjoy reading about... health, software, fantasy & everything mythological (thus the large black work tattooed on my back).

I take interest in what open blockchains can bring to this world & the finance/on-chain data bonanza that comes with it.

I love music. all of it, from your classical, blues, jazz, rock, heavy metal, drum & bass... it's all beautiful. It's all connected & passed on (shout out Seamus Heaney).

This "portfolio" or "personal internet space" stems from an internal need to have a platform to express some - hopefully educated - thoughts on interesting learnings & discoveries (not that of my wonderful company <3).

As an inspiration from the awesome work by the Risk Ledger Engineering team...
