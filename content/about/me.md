Hello there! I'm a full-stack software engineer :)

Currently, I'm full stacking at Risk Ledger.

Previously, I was dev-opsing at Cisco.

I like to learn about all sorts of tech.

I enjoy a weekly dose of Muay Thai & Yoga.

My hippy self enjoys the science of nutrition and health (physical & mental).

I'm particularly keen about cinematography and take particular joy in video editing.

I enjoy reading about...  health, software, fantasy & everything mythological (thus the large black work tattooed on my back).

I take edgy interest in open blockchains & related finance/on-chain data.

I love music. all of it, from your classical, blues, jazz, rock, heavy metal, drum & bass... why are we even labelling, it's all beautiful. It's all connected and passed on (shout out Seamus Heaney).

This "portfolio" or "personal internet space" stems from an internal need to have a platform to express some thoughts (not that of my wonderful company <3). I want to be able to have a place where I can write about new things that I've learnt about and the rest of the world that surrounds me.

As an inspiration from the awesome work by the Risk Ledger Engineering team...

Powered by: Vercel, NuxtJS, TailwindCSS, Forestry, probably soonishly, when I need it to feel cooler Typescript?...
