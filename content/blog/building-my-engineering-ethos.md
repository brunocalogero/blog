## Building my Engineering Ethos

"The Mediator Between the Head and the Hands Must Be the Heart".

I start this article with an iconic line from the famous "Metropolis" and an incessant urge to use chatGPT to generate some of this content. Promise, I won't.

This is a years-long worth of reflections into something that is digestible.
I have to warn that it remains "organic" as I face new situations that inevitably lead to new learnings. It does, however, remain my first attempt at organizing my thoughts.
The hope is that it might help some of you who are trying to make sense of all these emotions.

After having worked four and a half years at a startup, from its humble beginnings when we were only 5, to series A; I have built various ways to remain productive, motivated and pragmatic as a **product engineer**.
I always wanted to build a personal framework that I can simply follow to remain sharp at a more "psychological" level.

In this type of environment it is extremely important to know how to manage yourself, no one else will do this for you. Especially if this is one of your first jobs. Being autonomous and getting the right things done, at a certain pace, is key here.

### Principles

#### **"Do more, say less"**

- I often found myself in situations where I'd commit to something, only to quickly realize that other more urgent tasks would inevitably interfere, making it challenging to keep my promises.
- This is something that - in a small team - can cause the immediate and dreaded build-up of mistrust from management or your more "senior" peers. Rebuilding trust is significantly more challenging than maintaining a consistent level of trust.
- This doesn't necessarily mean that you are not a good engineer, but being a "keen bean" is a double-edged sword.
- As Gergely Orosz ("The Pragmatic engineer") would put it, "*aim to be in the reliable group*" no matter how much you feel the need to prove yourself. Consistency is more important.
- To ensure this consistency, a phrase that I borrowed from *Atomic Habits* really helped: **"Reduce scope stick to schedule"**.
  - At the end of the day delivering something, as little as it may be is better then delivering an empty promise. It shows that you tried. You can always gage the excitement for a first version of a feature and use it as motivation to move in the right direction.
  - You can also decide to scrap it and move on. By doing this the choice is ultimately yours. That's the beauty of it.
  - You will find that doing this will not only make you more pragmatic and proactive but it will boost your morale too.
- *Before you go*: From another point of view, saying less is often valuable, you don't always need to over-explain. As The hollistic psychologist mentions, "over-explaining is an anxiety based habit that shows we aren't comfortable making our own decisions". And this applies to many more things in life.
  - Strive to always be concise in communication, avoid suggestions when they are not needed or aren't correctly founded / researched. Avoid jumping to conclusions.

#### **"See a need, fill a need"**

- This one can be hard to apply in practice but when combined with the above it can work like magic.
- I have to give credit to Mark Sullivan, my early mentor. I believe he was watching the [2005 animated movie *Robots*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFVlyKRVgwg)(underrated af btw) and it really hit the nail in the head.
- Smaller tasks, bigger tasks, refactoring tasks, piping tasks, proposals, discovery & research. When you see that there is a need for something - especially if it has personal and business impact - it is worth filling that need.
  - I'd also recommend something that preferably makes you grow. Defining what makes you grow is a whole different discussion so I will assume you have a vague idea of what that might be.
- To illustrate this quote, I'll use none other than myself:
  - With the obvious advent of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), and my experience building the product, it was obvious that a lot of our core offering could be automated.
  - Yes I know, I know, this might be giving off "jump on the hype train" vibes but hear me out, this is just an easy example.
  - Indeed, the core flow involves uploading files (95%+ of which are PDFs). These files are used as evidence to questions. It was therefore a no-brainer for me to fill the need by attempting to automate the process of answering the questions.
  - This came in the form of delivering a concrete demo. This demo has to be "palpable" and inspiring. Viewers must see the vision immediately. You have to be telling a story.
- Taking a look at the more successful people around me, I keep on seeing countless examples like this one.
  - A proposal is often written explaining the identified need and usually, depending on the scale of the project either a full out demo is delivered or a pull request is opened up. (Sometimes just a proposal is not enough.)
  - This is often what make these engineers seen as people who "get stuff done".
- In summary, filling the need doesn't always need to be accepted, your solution might not always actually solve a business need. But one thing is certain, you will prove your pragmatism, become more proactive and potentially inspire people around you.
- *Before you go*: "Produce, organise, publish", don't always wait for opportunities to come to you, create your opportunities and remember, if you don't ask you don't get.

#### **"This is the last time you’ll be so shit at it"**

- When I first accepted that a sedentary life in front of my computer was not something I wanted - or needed, I decided someone should teach me how to lift weights.
- The thing is, I'm an extremely self-critical person. One thing I used to always say was "ahh I'm so shit at this" every time I'd start a new exercise.
- One day however, my coach couldn't stand it any longer, just shook his head, stared down at me and firmly pronounced words which I still use to this day whenever I have to face any "fear of the blank page" style problem: "Well, It'll be the last time you'll be so shit at it".
- This is a very powerful way to face new challenges. Especially for engineers whose mantra has always been to "keep learning" - until you die.
- A few years after this event I stumbled upon a book from Jonah Hill's psychiatrist, "The Tools".
- Aside from being an obvious new-age stereotypical self-help "I'll solve all your problems" kind of book, it actually was quite nice from my POV given that I'm a visual learner.
- In this book, the author mentions a strategy to overcome the fear or resistance of doing something challenging.
- He portrays the idea of pushing through the pain, overcoming procrastination and resistance by altering ones idea and approach to desire and motivation.
- He pushes the idea or tool of the "reversal of desire". In other words, embracing "the suck" by facing the pain; moving towards the pain until you're at one with it and finally accepting the pain.
- The truth is, it's not always easy. Applying the first two points requires a certain level of motivation, and some people need a whole new perspective to activate that consistent push to get through the pain.
- *Before you go*: Actively seek for help and support when needed and earlier.

#### **“Eat the fish, spit the bones”**

- The first time I heard this was in one of [Primeagen](https://www.youtube.com/c/theprimeagen)'s youtube videos.
- This, to me, has been an amazing quote with respect to feedback.
- As the pragmatic engineer puts it, "Take feedback seriously but remember that it's opinion and not a directive". As a young engineer, with, let's admit it, an ancestral pattern of temper and sometimes taking things a bit too personally, this quote has made me a much better engineer.
- It is very empowering to think this way. The last thing you want when receiving (or giving) feedback is to build up resentment. It's just unproductive, believe me.
- I also use this outside of work, it's a rule of life really; the nature of feedback is that you have the power to decide what you do with it - you don't have to take it as a commandment.
- Gergely puts it nicely: "push back on vague feedback which neglects specifics [...] However, once you know the specifics, reflect on the message and think about whether you can - or want - to take action.".
- *Before you go*: Remember, opinions are like assholes, everybody has one and most of them don't smell good. Even more relevant with all the social media bull crap we are fed on a daily basis.

### Conclusion

I really hope these little nuggets have helped put things in perspective for you, the reader, they certainly have for me. On a final note:

- There will always be another to take what you think is yours, it’s your decision and free will to either accept it or reject it.
- Some things are just out of your control, but it is your responsibility to control the things that you are in control of.
- Almost everyone is selfish and thinking about their own growth. Don't let that be your limiting factor.

I have to give props to Gergely Orosz's (The Pragmatic Engineer) Software Engineer Guidebook. This book contains an immense amount of knowledge that is well geared in the space of self-management and what type of engineer to be in order to be successful. I'd highly recommend the reader to take a look. Most notably the notions of "logging your work" and creating a "brag document" to track your progress on a daily and weekly basis.

As Gergely says, regardless of anything, "if you are not seen as someone who gets stuff done, then nothing else will matter".

"You can shine no matter what you are made of".
